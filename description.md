# Overview

Modern technologies are able to deliver an unprecedented amount of data rapidly. However, without due care and attention early in the experimental process, such data are meaningless if they cannot adequately answer the intended research question. This course is aimed at those planning high-throughput experiments and highlights the kinds of questions they should be asking themselves. The course consists of a lecture and small-group discussions led by a member of the Genomics or Bioinformatics Cores.

# Aims: During this course you will learn about

- Why perform experiments?
- Why think about experimental design?
- What makes for a well-designed experiment?
- Aspects of experimental design
  + Experimental variables
  + Power, variance and replicates
â€“ Bias, confounding factors, randomisation and
controls
- Experimental design types
- Experimental design at CRUK. C.I.


# Objectives: After this course you should be able to

- Prepare for a Experimental Design Meeting you the Genomics and Bioinformatics Cores
-
