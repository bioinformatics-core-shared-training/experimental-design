# experimental-design
A Course on designing high-throughput experiments

The ExperimentalDesignPractical.Rmd contains the solutions as well as the
practical. The YAML includes a parameter that determines if the code chunks
containing the solutions are evaluated of not. The script xRenderPractical.sh
will render both the practical without the solutions and the practical with
solutions.
